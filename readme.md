# Backbone.Presentation

A slide deck with code samples, for introducing Backbone.js

## Abstract

In the last year, Backbone.js has made a big splash in the world of 
JavaScrit and Single-Page-Applications ("SPAs"). This MV* library
provides a lot of great functionality and assistance in organizing and writing
maintainable JavaScript code. 

In this presentation, you'll learn how to get Backbone.js up and running on
[Sinatra, ASP.NET MVC], quickly. Derick Bailey will walk you through building
a sample application from the ground up, illustrating many of the most important
concepts and constructs in Backbone. He'll also show you some of the tricks and
some of the hard lessons that he has learned while creating apps of all sizes -
all with the goal of clean, organized code.

## Code Samples
